# Image Restoration Using UNET Model

This repository contains the code and resources for an image restoration project using a UNET model. The goal of this project is to restore blurred images to their original sharpness using deep learning techniques.

## Problem Statement

The prevalence of blurred or low-quality images due to camera limitations, environmental conditions, or motion presents a significant challenge. Blurred images can lead to misinterpretation of critical information, reducing their utility and reliability in fields like medical imaging, surveillance, and photography.

## Solution

This project leverages the UNET architecture, a type of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), to automatically restore blurred images to their original sharpness. The solution includes a user-friendly interface that allows users to upload blurred images and receive restored versions seamlessly.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- OpenCV
- Pillow
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Flask
- Docker

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   https://github.com/srikartv/DetectPixelatedImage_and_Correct_It-

2. Train the Model:
   ```sh
   python train.py
   
3. Run the Interface:
   ```sh
   python interface.py

# other approach
Run model2.py for direct execution and ouput.
